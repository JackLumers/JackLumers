## Hi. Iâ€™m Ilyas Kharisov, a game programmer.

There is no any fancy open source games repos at the moment. 
But I have some test task projects that I made for my employment opportunities.

For example: 
* [Card Game Sample](https://github.com/JackLumers/Card-Game-Sample)
* [Local Multiplayer Battle Sample](https://github.com/JackLumers/Multiplayer-Battle-Sample)
