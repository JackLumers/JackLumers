## Hi, Iâ€™m Ilyas Kharisov, a passioned game developer.

There is no any fancy open source game repos at the moment. But I have some test task projects that I made for my employment opportunities.

For example: 
* [Card Game Sample](https://github.com/JackLumers/Card-Game-Sample)
* [Local Multiplayer Battle Sample](https://github.com/JackLumers/MultiplayerBattleSample)
